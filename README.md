# RSO-Database
This contains the code to create a simple RSO database based on the below Entity Relationship Diagram

After creating the database using SQL, it was populated with sample data for proof of concept.
Using the sample data, visualizations were created using Tableau

## Why is this important?
A problem evident to as college students is the lack of organization in RSOs. Decentralized data can cause inefficiencies among the organizations, slowing down processes, and can even cause information to be lost as members graduate or leave the organization. 
Due to the non-competitive nature of most RSOs, we think a shared database is an optimal solution. This can help each organization grow their organization and improve their processes by making data more available to them as well as make it centralized.

## Data visualization
You can see the visualizations with the sample data [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/saasha8720#!/vizhome/RSODatabaseVisualization/Story1?publish=yes)
Data visualization is an extremely important aspect of this since it allows users to quickly infer what the vast pool of data means and make decisions on the basis of it. 
For this project I looked at the following metrics
- Member retention i.e. the amount of time a member is part of the club
- Most used locations which are successful i.e. which have high turnout and receive more funding
- Participation in events depending on the fee amount collecting
